materialistic-q155: 'To answer the question concisely, I will choose the number that
  represents the most important aspect and the one that is considered least important
  in the given options.


  1. For the most important aspect:

  "Tabbatar da doka da oda a cikin kasa" translates to "Ensuring security and peace
  within the country." Security and peace within a country are fundamental for stability
  and progress. Therefore, this can be considered the most crucial aspect in the given
  options.


  2. For the least important aspect:

  "Tabbatar da kiyaye yancin fada aji" translates to "Ensuring the distribution of
  food supplies." While ensuring the distribution of food supplies is important for
  the well-being of the people, it may be considered less critical compared to other
  options such as security and governance.


  Therefore, my choices are:

  ```

  ||[[1. Tabbatar da doka da oda a cikin kasa, 4. Tabbatar da kiyaye yancin fada aji]]||
