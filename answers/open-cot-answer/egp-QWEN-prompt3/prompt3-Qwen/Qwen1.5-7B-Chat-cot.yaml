abortion-q184: "The survey question is asking for an individual's opinion on when\
  \ abortion can be considered justified or not. It presents a three-point scale:\n\
  \n1. \"\u0623\u0628\u062F\u0627\u064B \u0645\u0628\u0631\u0631\" (Never justified)\
  \ - corresponds to a strong negative stance, meaning someone believes abortion should\
  \ never be a justifiable reason.\n2. \"\u0643\u0644\u0645\u0627\u064B \u0645\u0628\
  \u0631\u0631\" (Always justified) - indicates a strong positive stance, suggesting\
  \ abortion should always be allowed under certain circumstances.\n3. \"\u0634\u064A\
  \u0621 \u0628\u064A\u0646\u0647\u0645\u0627\" (Sometime justified) - implies a middle\
  \ ground, where there may be situations where abortion can be morally acceptable.\n\
  \nTo provide a reasoning using the question's language, one would choose the number\
  \ that best represents their belief. Here's how each option could be interpreted:\n\
  \n- If someone selects \"\u0623\u0628\u062F\u0627\u064B \u0645\u0628\u0631\u0631\
  ,\" they believe that abortion should never be an acceptable reason, possibly due\
  \ to moral, religious, or ethical reasons.\n- If they choose \"\u0643\u0644\u0645\
  \u0627\u064B \u0645\u0628\u0631\u0631,\" they hold that abortion can be justified\
  \ in any situation, possibly because of exceptions like preserving life, rape, or\
  \ fetal abnormalities.\n- If they pick \"\u0634\u064A\u0621 \u0628\u064A\u0646\u0647\
  \u0645\u0627,\" they believe that abortion can be justified under specific circumstances\
  \ but not universally, acknowledging that there might be gray areas.\n\nBased on\
  \ this, the most appropriate answer would depend on the individual's personal beliefs\
  \ and values regarding abortion. Some might lean towards 1, others might choose\
  \ 3, and still, others might opt for 2, depending on their stance."
authority-q45: "The question asks for an opinion on whether a future scenario where\
  \ \"greater respect for authority\" would be considered good, bad, or indifferent.\
  \ Here's the reasoning using the language of the question:\n\n1. \"\u0625\u0630\u0627\

  \ is asking if you believe that a higher level of respect for authority would be\
  \ a positive thing. The word \"\u0623\u0645\u0648\u0631\u0627\u064B \u062C\u064A\
  \u062F\u0627\u064B\" suggests a favorable view.\n\n3. \"\u0623\u0645 \u0633\u064A\
  \u0626\u0627\u064B\" - This part is seeking your judgment on the opposite, whether\
  \ a greater respect for authority would be negative. If you choose option 1 (\u0623\
  \u0645\u0631 \u062C\u064A\u062F), it implies you think it's a positive outcome.\n\
  \n4. \"\u0623\u0645 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0644\u0627 \u064A\
  \u0647\u0645\u0643\" - This alternative suggests that the matter doesn't concern\
  \ you. If you choose option 2, it indicates that you don't see the significance\
  \ of the issue.\n\nBased on the question's language, if you believe that a greater\
  \ respect for authority could lead to better governance, social stability, or positive\
  \ outcomes, then answering with option 1 (\u0623\u0645\u0631 \u062C\u064A\u062F\
  ) would be appropriate. However, if you feel that respect for authority should not\
  \ be the primary focus or has more drawbacks, option 3 (\u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0633\
  \u064A\u0626) might make sense. If you don't have a strong opinion either way, option\
  \ 2 (\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0644\u0627 \u064A\u0647\u0645\u0646\u064A\
  ) would be a neutral response."

god-q164: "The survey question asks about the importance of God in one's life using\
  \ a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 represents \"very important\" and 1 means \"not\
  \ at all important.\" The task is to provide reasoning using the language of the\
  \ question.\n\n1. **Understanding the Scale**: The scale is a quantitative representation,\
  \ allowing for a numerical response that directly corresponds to the degree of significance\
  \ God holds in someone's life. \n2. **Justification**: To respond, I would need\
  \ to assess how significant God is in my personal beliefs, values, and daily life.\
  \ If God is central to one's faith and influences decision-making and moral principles,\
  \ a higher number (like 10) would be appropriate. Conversely, if God has little\
  \ impact, a lower number (like 1) would be the justification.\n3. **Reasoning**:\
  \ If I believe that God plays a vital role in guiding me, providing comfort, and\
  \ shaping my worldview, I would choose a high number (e.g., 9 or 10) because it\
  \ reflects the depth of their importance in my life. If, on the other hand, I don't\
  \ actively seek out religious guidance or consider God's influence minimal, a lower\
  \ number (e.g., 1 or 2) would make sense.\n\nUltimately, the reasoning will depend\
  \ on an individual's personal relationship with God and its impact on their life."

materialistic-q155: "1. To preserve the system (stability, security, and law): This\

  \ policy-making is essential for democracy. If people feel their opinions matter,\
  \ they are more likely to support and trust the government, leading to a better\
  \ system but not necessarily ranking second in importance.\n\nBased on the language\
  \ of the question, it seems that \"preserving the system\" would be the most important,\
  \ as it sets the foundation for all other aspects. However, \"having people impact\
