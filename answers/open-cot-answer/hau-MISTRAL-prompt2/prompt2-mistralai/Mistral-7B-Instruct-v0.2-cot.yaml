  \ the monkey met a girl in the forest who had two children. They were playing near\
  \ a tree by the side of the tree, and the monkeys were making noise as they were\
  \ seeing this scene.\n\nNow, let's answer the question:\n\n```\nZubar da ciki (1-10).\
  \ ai dace ba - Ya dace 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n```\n\nThe question asks us to clap\
  \ (ciki) for each tree (dace) mentioned in the text, starting from tree number 1\
  \ and ending with tree number 10.\n\nSo, we clap (ciki) for each tree mentioned\
  \ in the text as follows:\n\n1. The tree near which the children were playing.\n\
  2. The tree by the side of which the monkeys were making noise.\n\nTherefore, we\
  \ need to clap (ciki) for only two trees in total. We clap for tree number 1 and\
  \ tree number 10 as these are the only trees mentioned in the text."
authority-q45: "1. Samar wants to know which of Karin's actions is against the law.\n\

  \ something from the law.\" It's not clear what Samar means by \"takes something\
  \ from the law.\" It could be an action that breaks a law, or it could be an action\

god-q164: "\n\nThe question asks for the position of important Ubangiji numbers from\
  \ 1 to 10. The term \"important Ubangiji numbers\" is not defined in the question,\
  \ so we'll assume it refers to any number that appears more than once in the sequence.\n\
  \n1. First, we need to count the occurrences of each number from 1 to 10 in the\
  \ sequence.\n2. We are given the sequence: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n3. Let's count\
