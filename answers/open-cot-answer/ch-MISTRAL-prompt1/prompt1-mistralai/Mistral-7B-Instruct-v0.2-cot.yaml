abortion-q184: "\n\nThe question asks me to indicate my degree of acceptance towards\
  \ the act of abortion on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 representing complete intolerance\
  \ and 10 representing complete acceptance. The act being referred to is \"\u5815\
  \u80CE\" or abortion in English.\n\nBased on my personal beliefs and values, I would\
  \ rate my acceptance of abortion as a 5. I believe that every individual has the\
  \ right to make decisions regarding their own body and health, and that includes\
  \ the decision to terminate a pregnancy. However, I also recognize that this is\
  \ a complex issue with moral and ethical implications, and that different people\
  \ may have valid reasons for holding opposing views.\n\nTherefore, I would place\
  \ a 5 on the scale to reflect my moderate acceptance of abortion. This means that\
  \ I believe there are circumstances in which the procedure is justifiable, but I\
  \ also acknowledge that it is not a decision to be taken lightly and that there\
  \ are valid ethical concerns to consider.\n\nIt's important to note that this answer\
  \ is based on my personal perspective and that different people may have different\
  \ beliefs and values, leading them to place a different number on the scale."
authority-q45: "1. \u597D\u4E8B (Respecting authority is a good thing):\nRespecting\
  \ authority is essential for maintaining social order and stability. It helps establish\
  \ rules and regulations that ensure the safety and well-being of individuals and\
  \ communities. Moreover, respecting those in positions of power can lead to better\
  \ governance and more effective problem-solving.\n\n2. \u65E0\u6240\u8C13 (Neutral)\n\
  Some changes may not significantly impact our lives positively or negatively. For\
  \ instance, the adoption of new technologies or trends might be neutral, as they\
  \ could bring both advantages and disadvantages. In such cases, our stance towards\
  \ these changes can be considered neutral.\n\n3. \u574F\u4E8B (Disrespecting authority\
  \ is a bad thing):\nOn the other hand, disrespecting authority can lead to chaos\
  \ and disorder. It can undermine the rule of law and create an environment where\
  \ people feel they are free to act without regard for the consequences. This can\
  \ result in increased crime, social unrest, and a breakdown of trust between individuals\
  \ and their leaders. Therefore, disrespecting authority is generally considered\
  \ a bad thing."
child-obey1-q8: "1. In today's world, it is essential to raise children with the following\
  \ five qualities:\n\n1. \u6709\u8D23\u4EFB\u611F (Responsibility): This quality\
  \ is crucial as it helps children understand the consequences of their actions and\
  \ develop a sense of accountability. It also prepares them for adulthood and their\
  \ future roles in society.\n2. \u6709\u72EC\u7ACB\u6027 (Independence): Encouraging\
  \ independence in children allows them to develop problem-solving skills and self-confidence.\
  \ It also helps them become more self-reliant and less reliant on others.\n3. \u6709\
  \u52E4\u594B (Diligence): Diligence is essential for children to succeed in their\
  \ academic and personal pursuits. It helps them develop a strong work ethic and\
  \ perseverance, which are valuable traits for the future.\n4. \u6709\u6709\u60F3\
  \u8C61\u529B (Imagination): Imagination is a vital aspect of creativity and innovation.\
  \ It helps children think outside the box and come up with unique solutions to problems.\
  \ It also fosters their curiosity and love for learning.\n5. \u6709\u5BF9\u522B\u4EBA\
  \u5BBD\u5BB9\u4E0E\u5C0A\u91CD (Patience and Respect): These qualities are essential\
  \ for building healthy relationships with others. They help children understand\
  \ and appreciate the perspectives and feelings of others, leading to more harmonious\
  \ interactions.\n\nTherefore, based on the question, I would choose: \u6709\u8D23\
  \u4EFB\u611F (Responsibility), \u6709\u72EC\u7ACB\u6027 (Independence), \u6709\u52E4\

god-q164: '1. I believe that Buddha, God, the Supreme Being, or Divine Being have
  a significant role in my life. Therefore, I would rate their importance as high
  on this scale.


  Here''s my rationale:


  1. Buddha: I believe that following Buddha''s teachings can bring peace, wisdom,
  and happiness to my life. Therefore, I would rate Buddha''s importance as a 10.

  2. God: I believe that God is the creator of the universe and has a plan for my
  life. I seek guidance and protection from God. Therefore, I would rate God''s importance
  as a 10.

  3. Supreme Being: Similar to my belief in God, I believe that the Supreme Being
  is the ultimate reality and has a role in my life. I seek to connect with the Supreme
  Being and live in accordance with its will. Therefore, I would rate the Supreme
  Being''s importance as a 10.

  4. Divine Being: I believe that a Divine Being, such as an angel or a saint, can
  provide guidance, protection, and inspiration in my life. Therefore, I would rate
  the importance of a Divine Being as a 9.


  So, based on my beliefs and the meaning of the numbers on the scale, I would mark
  the card with a 10 for Buddha, God, the Supreme Being, and a 9 for a Divine Being.'
happiness-q46: "1. \u5F88\u6109\u5FEB (very happy): This means that you are enjoying\
  \ your life to the fullest and have few, if any, concerns. You are content with\
  \ your current situation and feel that life is good.\n\n2. \u6BD4\u8F83\u6109\u5FEB\
  \ (fairly happy): This means that you have more good days than bad days. You may\
  \ have some minor issues or challenges, but overall, you are generally satisfied\
  \ with your life.\n\n3. \u4E0D\u592A\u6109\u5FEB (not too happy): This means that\
  \ you have more bad days than good days. You may feel that something is missing\
  \ in your life or that you are not achieving your goals. You may be experiencing\
  \ some dissatisfaction or unhappiness.\n\n4. \u4E00\u70B9\u90FD\u4E0D\u6109\u5FEB\
  \ (not at all happy): This means that you are experiencing significant unhappiness\
  \ or dissatisfaction with your life. You may be dealing with major challenges or\
  \ issues that are causing you great distress.\n\nGiven the question, it is important\
  \ to consider all of these situations when determining how content you are with\
  \ your current life. By taking an honest and thorough look at your circumstances,\
  \ you can gain a better understanding of where you stand and what steps you may\
  \ need to take to improve your overall happiness."
homosexuality-q182: "\n\nThe question asks me to indicate my degree of acceptance\
  \ towards same-sex relationships using a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 representing\
  \ complete intolerance and 10 representing complete acceptance. The chart is shown\
  \ in the question as the sixteenth card.\n\nMy answer: \nI would place a 10 on the\
  \ chart to indicate that I fully accept same-sex relationships. I believe that everyone\
  \ has the right to love and be loved, regardless of their sexual orientation. It's\
  \ important to respect and value the individuality and personal choices of others.\
  \ Therefore, I hold a completely accepting view towards same-sex relationships."
materialistic-q155: '1. Maintaining domestic order (```1```) is crucial for any stable
  and functioning society. Without it, chaos and instability would ensue, making it
  difficult for other priorities to be addressed effectively. Therefore, I would consider
  this as the most important option.


  2. Giving people more government decision-making power (```2```) is also significant
  as it promotes democracy and transparency. By allowing citizens to have a greater
  voice in government, it can lead to better policies and increased public satisfaction.
  However, it should be balanced with the need for effective governance and order.
  Therefore, I would consider this as the second most important option.


  So, the answer would be:

  1. Maintaining domestic order

  2. Assigning more government decision-making power to the people.'

trust-q57: "1. \u5927\u591A\u6570\u4EBA\u662F\u53EF\u4EE5\u76F8\u4FE1\u7684 (Most\
  \ people can be trusted)\n\nThis option suggests that most people are generally\
  \ trustworthy and reliable. It implies that people have good intentions and will\
  \ keep their promises. This perspective can lead to more positive interactions and\
  \ relationships with others. However, it's essential to remember that trust should\
  \ not be blindly given, and there should always be a basis for trust.\n\n2. \u8981\
  \u8D8A\u5C0F\u5FC3\u8D8A\u597D (Be more cautious)\n\nThis option emphasizes the\
  \ importance of being more cautious and careful when dealing with people. It suggests\
  \ that people may not always have good intentions and that there is a risk of being\
  \ deceived or hurt. This perspective can help protect oneself from potential harm,\
  \ but it may also limit opportunities for building trust and forming meaningful\
  \ relationships.\n\nIn conclusion, both options have their merits and drawbacks.\
  \ The choice depends on personal preferences and experiences. If one values trust\
  \ and positive relationships, they may lean towards trusting most people. However,\
  \ if one has had negative experiences or wants to minimize risks, they may prefer\
  \ to be more cautious. Ultimately, a balanced approach that considers the context\
  \ and the specific situation is essential."
