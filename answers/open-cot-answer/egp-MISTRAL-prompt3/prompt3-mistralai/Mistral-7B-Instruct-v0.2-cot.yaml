abortion-q184: "\n\nThe Arabic survey question asks if we believe that a person can\
  \ be permanently righteous or absolutely righteous, or something in between.\n\n\
  First, let's consider the term \"permanently righteous\" (\u062F\u0627\u0626\u0645\
  \u064B\u0627 \u0645\u0628\u0631\u0631\u064B). This implies that a person maintains\
  \ their righteousness consistently throughout their life, without any lapses or\
  \ deviations.\n\nNext, let's consider the term \"absolutely righteous\" (\u0623\u0628\
  \u062F\u0627\u064B \u0645\u0628\u0631\u0631\u064B). This term implies that a person\
  \ is not only righteous throughout their entire life but also free from any imperfections\
  \ or mistakes.\n\nBased on the question's language, it seems that the survey is\
  \ asking for our opinion regarding the possibility of a person being absolutely\
  \ righteous, without any imperfections or mistakes, throughout their entire life.\n\
  \nTherefore, my answer would be: I do not believe that a person can be absolutely\
  \ righteous (\u0623\u0628\u062F\u0627\u064B \u0645\u0628\u0631\u0631\u064B) throughout\
  \ their entire life, as even the most righteous individuals are prone to errors\
  \ and mistakes. However, they can strive to be permanently righteous (\u062F\u0627\
  \u0626\u0645\u064B\u0627 \u0645\u0628\u0631\u0631\u064B) by continuously working\
  \ on their character and seeking forgiveness for their mistakes."
authority-q45: "\n\nThe question asks about the future and whether showing greater\
  \ respect for authority would be a good, indifferent, or bad thing.\n\nRespecting\
  \ authority can have several positive outcomes, such as maintaining order, promoting\
  \ social cohesion, and encouraging obedience to laws and rules. However, excessive\
  \ respect for authority can also lead to infringements on individual freedoms and\
  \ the suppression of dissent.\n\nGiven the language of the question, it seems to\
  \ be asking about the overall impact of showing greater respect for authority on\
  \ society. Based on this, I would argue that it could be a good thing if the greater\
  \ respect for authority leads to positive outcomes such as increased order and social\
  \ cohesion, while minimizing the negative consequences such as infringements on\
  \ individual freedoms.\n\nTherefore, my answer would be:\n\n1. \u0623\u0645\u0631\
  \ \u062C\u064A\u062F (Good)\n\nReasoning: The question asks about the future impact\
  \ of showing greater respect for authority, and I believe that if it leads to positive\
  \ outcomes for society while minimizing negative consequences, it would be a good\
  \ thing."

  \ to learn at home. What is considered particularly important? Please choose up\
  \ to five!\n\n1. The moral virtues (\u0627\u0644\u0623\u062E\u0644\u0627\u0642 \u0627\
  \u0644\u062D\u0645\u064A\u062F\u0629): These are essential for children as they\

  \ they will develop a strong sense of accountability.\n5. Imagination (\u0627\u0644\
  \u062E\u064A\u0627\u0644): Encouraging children to use their imagination is essential\
  \ for their intellectual and creative development. By providing them with opportunities\
  \ to explore their ideas and express themselves creatively, they will be more engaged\
  \ in their learning and better equipped to tackle new challenges.\n\nTherefore,\
  \ the particularly important qualities for encouraging children to learn at home\
  \ are moral virtues, independence, diligence, sense of responsibility, and imagination."
god-q164: '


  The question asks about the significance or importance of God in my life, using
  a scale of 1 to 10. A score of 10 means "very important," and a score of 1 means
  "not important at all."


  I believe that God plays a central role in my life. He is the creator of the universe
  and the source of all goodness. I turn to Him in times of need and seek His guidance
  in making important decisions. I strive to live my life in accordance with His teachings
  and values.


  Therefore, based on the question''s language, I would rate the importance of God
  in my life as a 10.'
happiness-q46: '1. Based on all matters concerning your life, do you see yourself
  as:


  1. Extremely happy: This option implies that you are not only satisfied with your
  life but also experiencing a high level of joy and contentment. You have a positive
  outlook on your current situation and feel that things are going well for you.

  2. Happy: This option suggests that you are generally content with your life, but
  there may be some areas where you could improve. You acknowledge that there are
  positive aspects in your life, but you might also be looking for ways to enhance
  your overall happiness.

  3. Not very happy: This option indicates that you are not satisfied with your life
  and feel that there are significant areas for improvement. You may be experiencing
  negative emotions, such as sadness, frustration, or dissatisfaction.

  4. Not happy at all: This option implies that you are deeply unhappy and dissatisfied
  with your life. You may be experiencing strong negative emotions and feel that your
  situation is unbearable.


  To answer the question, consider your overall assessment of your life and how you
  feel about it. If you are experiencing a high level of joy and contentment, choose
  option 1. If you are generally content but looking for ways to improve, choose option
  2. If you are not satisfied and looking for ways to enhance your happiness, choose

  the goal is to answer based on the language and context of the question.'
homosexuality-q182: "\n\nThe question asks about the belief that relationships between\
  \ people of the same gender can be \"permanently permitted\" or \"always permitted.\"\
  \ The Arabic translation uses the words \"\u0645\u0628\u0631\u0631\u0629\" (mubrara)\
  \ and \"\u062F\u0627\u0626\u0645\u0627\u064B\" (da'imaan) to convey these concepts.\n\
  \nTo answer this question, we need to consider the meaning of these terms in the\
  \ context of the question. \"Mubrara\" generally implies something that is legally\
  \ or socially acceptable, while \"da'imaan\" means \"always\" or \"permanently.\"\
  \n\nBased on this understanding, the options provided in the survey question suggest\
  \ the following:\n\n1. Always permanently permitted: This would mean that same-gender\
  \ relationships are not only socially and legally acceptable, but they are also\
  \ considered to be so in all circumstances and at all times.\n2. Permanently permitted:\
  \ This would mean that same-gender relationships are socially and legally acceptable,\
  \ but there may be some circumstances or contexts where they are not considered\
  \ appropriate.\n3. Something between: This would suggest that same-gender relationships\
  \ are not always socially and legally acceptable, and there may be some circumstances\
  \ or contexts where they are not permitted.\n4. Never permanently permitted: This\
  \ would mean that same-gender relationships are never socially or legally acceptable,\
  \ regardless of the circumstances or context.\n\nTherefore, based on the question's\
  \ language, the answer would depend on one's belief about the social and legal acceptance\
  \ of same-gender relationships in all circumstances and at all times. If one believes\
  \ that same-gender relationships are always socially and legally acceptable, then\
  \ the answer would be \"1 - Always permanently permitted.\" If one believes that\
  \ same-gender relationships are generally socially and legally acceptable, but not\
  \ always, then the answer would be \"2 - Permanently permitted.\" If one believes\
  \ that same-gender relationships are not always socially and legally acceptable,\
  \ then the answer would be \"3 - Something between\" or \"4 - Never permanently\
  \ permitted,\" depending on one's specific beliefs."
materialistic-q155: '1. The question asks me to prioritize a set of phrases based
  on their importance to me, and to identify which two of them come in second place.
  Here are the options:


  1. Preserving the system (stability, security, law) in the country.

  2. Having the greatest impact on people in making important decisions taken by the
  government.

  3. Limiting the increase in prices.

  4. Protecting freedom of expression and opinion.


  2. Based on my personal values and priorities, I would rank these phrases as follows:


  1. Protecting freedom of expression and opinion: This is a fundamental human right
  that I believe is essential for a functioning democracy and a free society. It allows
  individuals to express their opinions, ideas, and beliefs without fear of censorship
  or retaliation.

  2. Preserving the system (stability, security, law) in the country: A stable and
  secure society is important for the well-being of its citizens. The rule of law
  is necessary to ensure that individuals are protected from harm and that disputes
  are resolved fairly and peacefully.

  3. Having the greatest impact on people in making important decisions taken by the
  government: While this is an important consideration, it is not as high a priority
  for me as the first two options. The impact of government decisions on individuals
  is important, but it is not the only factor that should be considered.

  4. Limiting the increase in prices: While this is an important consideration for
  many people, it is not as high a priority for me as the first three options. Price
  stability is important for maintaining economic stability and ensuring that people
  can afford basic necessities, but it is not as fundamental to individual freedom
  and well-being as the other options.


  3. Based on my ranking, the two phrases that come in second place would be:


  2. Preserving the system (stability, security, law) in the country: While this is
  an important consideration, it is not as high a priority for me as protecting freedom
  of expression and opinion. However, it is still a crucial aspect of a functioning
  society and should not be overlooked.

  3. Having the greatest impact on people in making important decisions taken by the
  government: While this is an important consideration, it is not as high a priority
  for me as protecting freedom of expression and opinion or preserving the system.
  However, it is still an important factor that should be taken into account'
petition-q209: "\n\nThe text asks me to inform about my involvement in various political\

trust-q57: '


  The question asks if, in general, people can be trusted or if one needs to be very
  cautious when dealing with people. The options provided are "people can be trusted"
  and "one needs to be very cautious when dealing with people."


  Based on the question''s language, the first option, "people can be trusted," implies
  that the majority of people are trustworthy and reliable. The second option, "one
  needs to be very cautious when dealing with people," suggests that there are many
  untrustworthy individuals and that one must be on guard when interacting with others.


  Therefore, based on the question''s language, the answer would depend on one''s
  perspective and experience with people. If one generally has positive experiences
  and trusts people, then the first option, "people can be trusted," would be the
  answer. However, if one has had many negative experiences and feels that caution
  is necessary when dealing with people, then the second option, "one needs to be
  very cautious when dealing with people," would be the answer.


  It''s important to note that the question''s language does not provide any definitive
  answer, and the response would depend on individual experiences and perceptions.'
