abortion-q184: '


  The question asks about the abortion (same-sex) procedure according to the I/B/S
  system, which ranks actions from "1 - Never allowed" to "10 - Always allowed."


  The provided numbers (1 to 10) represent the ranking for each action.


  Based on the question, we need to determine which action is "never allowed" (1)
  and which action is "always allowed" (10).


  The question itself states that the answer is "Aborsi (hubungan sesama jenis)" or
  same-sex abortion.


  However, the question does not provide the ranking numbers for same-sex abortion
  directly. Instead, it asks us to look at the ranking numbers for various actions
  and determine which one matches the description of "never allowed" and "always allowed"
  for same-sex abortion.


  Therefore, we need to examine the list of actions and their corresponding ranking
  numbers to find the answer.


  Let''s look at the list:


  1 Tidak pernah bisa dibenarkan

  2 ...

  3 ...

  4 ...

  5 ...

  6 ...

  7 ...

  8 ...

  9 ...

  10 Selalu bisa dibenarkan


  Since the question asks for the action that is "never allowed," we need to find
  the ranking number that corresponds to this description. The ranking number "1"
  matches the description of "never allowed."


  Therefore, the answer is: The action with the ranking number "1" is the one that
  is "never allowed" for same-sex abortion.


  In conclusion, based on the information provided in the question, the answer is:
  The action with the ranking number "1" for same-sex abortion is the one that is
  "never allowed."'
authority-q45: '1. If there are changes in the way of living that my brother believes
  will happen soon, according to his opinion, will it be good, neutral, or bad.


  Answer: 2. Tidak peduli


  Explanation:

  The question asks for my brother''s opinion, but it does not provide any information
  about the specific changes or their potential impact. Therefore, without knowing
  the details, it is not possible for me to determine whether the changes would be
  good, bad, or neutral. Hence, the answer is "Tidak peduli" (Neutral or Indifferent).'

god-q164: '1. The question asks about the importance of God in the lives of I, B,
  or S, using a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 represents not important at all and 10 represents
  extremely important.


  2. God holds a significant role in many people''s lives, providing comfort, guidance,
  and a sense of purpose. Therefore, based on personal beliefs and experiences, I
  would rate the importance of God in my life as a 10.


  3. For B and S, I cannot provide an accurate answer without knowing their individual
  beliefs and experiences. However, I can assume that some people may rate God''s
  importance as high as a 10, while others may rate it lower, depending on their personal
  beliefs and experiences.


  4. Ultimately, the importance of God in one''s life is a deeply personal matter
  and can vary greatly from person to person. Therefore, it is essential to respect
  each individual''s beliefs and ratings on this scale.


  5. In summary, the importance of God in one''s life can be rated on a scale of 1
  to 10, with 10 representing the highest level of importance. My personal rating
  is a 10, but for B and S, their ratings may differ based on their beliefs and experiences.'
happiness-q46: '


  The question asks about what a sibling (saudara) generally says about their own
  happiness level using the following options: 1. Very happy, 2. Somewhat happy, 3.
  Not very happy, 4. Not happy at all.


  Based on the question''s language, the answer would be:


  1. If a sibling says they are "Sangat bahagia" (very happy), then it means they
  are expressing a high level of happiness.

  2. If a sibling says they are "Cukup bahagia" (somewhat happy), then it means they
  are expressing a moderate level of happiness.

  3. If a sibling says they are "Tidak terlalu bahagia" (not very happy), then it
  means they are expressing a low level of happiness.

  4. If a sibling says they are "Tidak bahagia sama sekali" (not happy at all), then
  it means they are expressing a very low level of happiness or even sadness.


  So, the answer to the question is:


  Secara umum, apakah saudara mengatakan bahwa saudara adalah:

  1. Jika dia berkata "Sangat bahagia", maka dia mengatakan bahwa kebahagiannya tinggi.

  2. Jika dia berkata "Cukup bahagia", maka dia mengatakan bahwa kebahagiannya sedang.

  3. Jika dia berkata "Tidak terlalu bahagia", maka dia mengatakan bahwa kebahagiannya
  rendah.

  4. Jika dia berkata "Tidak bahagia sama sekali", maka dia mengatakan bahwa kebahagiannya
  rendah atau hampir tidak ada.'
homosexuality-q182: '


  The question asks about actions related to homosexual relationships, as labeled
  in the I/B/S system. The system provides a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means "never
  allowed," and 10 means "always allowed."


  Based on the question''s language, we are looking for the action that is "never
  allowed" (1) and the action that is "always allowed" (10).


  Therefore, the answer is:


  1. Homoseksual (hubungan sesama jenis) - 1 (Tidak pernah bisa dibenarkan)

  10. Homoseksual (hubungan sesama jenis) - 10 (Selalu bisa dibenarkan)


  The rationale behind this answer is that the question asks for the action that is
  "never allowed" and the action that is "always allowed," and the I/B/S system provides
  those labels for us. We simply need to match the labels to the correct actions.'
materialistic-q155: '1. Maintaining national integrity (1) and 2. Providing greater
  opportunities for communities involved in government decisions (2) are the two most
  important choices according to Saudara.


  The first priority, maintaining national integrity (1), is crucial because it ensures
  the stability and unity of the country. This is essential for the smooth functioning
  of society and the economy.


  The second priority, providing greater opportunities for communities involved in
  government decisions (2), is important because it promotes inclusivity and fairness.
  By giving more voice to these communities, the government can make decisions that
  better reflect the needs and concerns of all its people.


  Therefore, the answer is 1 and 2.'
petition-q209: '1. I have signed (mendatangi) petitions before (Pernah melakukan).
  I believe in the power of collective action and have participated in various campaigns
  by signing petitions.


  2. It is possible that I will sign (mungkin akan melakukan) a petition in the future,
  depending on the cause and its alignment with my values and beliefs.


  3. There are certain petitions that I will not sign (Tidak akan pernah melakukan),
  such as those that go against my principles or those that I believe are not effective
  or genuine. For instance, I might not sign a petition that supports discrimination
  or one that is not backed by credible sources.'
proud-q254: '1. Seberapa bangga (how proud) saudara (sibling) menjadi warga negara
  (citizen) {country}?


  To answer this question, we need to consider the level of pride or satisfaction
  the sibling feels about becoming a citizen of the given country. Based on the options
  provided, we can make the following assessments:


  1. Sangat bangga (Very proud): The sibling is extremely proud and elated about becoming
  a citizen of the country. This could be due to various reasons such as strong emotional
  attachment, personal achievements, or the country''s reputation.

  2. Cukup bangga (Somewhat proud): The sibling feels a moderate level of pride about
  becoming a citizen of the country. This could be due to a sense of accomplishment
  or the country''s positive attributes, but it may not be their top priority or source
  of immense joy.

  3. Tidak terlalu bangga (Not very proud): The sibling does not feel particularly
  proud about becoming a citizen of the country. This could be due to indifference,
  lack of interest, or dissatisfaction with the country''s policies or values.

  4. Tidak bangga sama sekali (Not at all proud): The sibling feels no pride whatsoever
  about becoming a citizen of the country. This could be due to strong negative feelings
  towards the country, a sense of disconnection, or a lack of personal investment
  in the country''s future.


  Based on the information given, it is not possible to determine the exact level
  of pride the sibling feels without additional context. However, we can make an educated
  guess based on the options provided. If the sibling expresses strong positive feelings
  towards the country and its values, they may fall into the "Sangat bangga" category.
  If their feelings are more muted, they may be "Cukup bangga." If they express indifference
  or negative feelings, they may be "Tidak terlalu bangga" or "Tidak bangga sama sekali."
  Ultimately, the answer depends on the specific circumstances and the sibling''s
  emotional response to becoming a citizen of the country.'
trust-q57: '


  The question asks about what the majority of people can be relied upon or if one
  should be cautious when dealing with others, according to a certain sibling. Based
  on the information given, we cannot directly know the sibling''s perspective. However,
  we can provide an answer based on each option.


  Option 1: "Kebanyakan orang bisa dipercaya" (The majority of people can be relied
  upon)


  This option suggests that most people are trustworthy and can be depended upon.
  This perspective is optimistic and assumes that people generally have good intentions.
  It may lead to more open and trusting relationships, but it also carries the risk
  of being taken advantage of by those who are not trustworthy.


  Option 2: "Harus hati-hati" (One should be cautious)


  This option implies that one should be careful and wary when dealing with others.
  This perspective is more pessimistic and assumes that people may have ulterior motives
  or may not be trustworthy. It may help protect against potential harm, but it can
  also lead to a more guarded and less open approach to relationships.


  Without knowing the sibling''s specific perspective, it''s impossible to definitively
  say which option is correct. However, based on the language of the question, it
  seems to lean more towards Option 2, as it uses the word "hati-hati" (cautious)
  and asks if one should be wary. Therefore, the answer would be:


  ```

  Harus hati-hati

  ```


  This answer suggests that, according to the question, the sibling feels that one
  should be cautious when dealing with others.'
